# Unhandled Exception in C# Method

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in C# exception handling: neglecting to re-throw an exception after handling part of it.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.  The `bug.cs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.cs` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code catches an exception, logs it, but doesn't re-throw it. This means that the calling method will not be aware of the exception, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures. 

## Solution

The solution involves re-throwing the exception using `throw;` or `throw ex;` after performing necessary logging or cleanup tasks. This allows calling methods to handle the exception appropriately.
